## Test your circuit

In this step, you will connect an LED and resistor to the Raspberry Pi to test your circuit.

Your jumper wire should have hollow female ends that fit over the pins. Connect a jumper wire to Pin 1, making sure it is a female to female wire. Pin 1 is always on and provides 3 volts of power to whatever you connect to it.

Take a resistor and insert one of itâ€™s legs into the other end of the jumper cable attached to Pin 1. Insert the other leg into another female-female jumper cable. 
We add a resistor to our circuit to control the **electrical current** passing through it, to protect the LED from burning out.

Insert the **long** leg of your LED into the end of this jumper cable, and connect the short leg back to Pin6 using another female-female jumper cable. As soon as you close the circuit by connecting it back to your ground pin, your LED will light up!

If your LED isn't lighting up, make sure you have the **long leg** connected to the output pin (Pin 1) and the **short leg** connected to the ground pin (Pin 6). LEDs only work one way round!

If your LED **still** isn't lighting up: check all your connections are secure and fit properly, then swap your LED for another one if it still won't work (this one might be broken).

In the next step, we will swap our working circuit to a numbered control pin so that we can drive it using code!
