## Test your circuit

In this step, you will connect an LED and resistor to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to test your circuit.

GPIO stands for **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput/**O**utput. GPIO pins allow you to create simple machines by sending a small electrical signal out of a pin, down a wire, through an output or input, and back into a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi to create a circuit. The behaviour of the circuits you make can be programmed and controlled through programs written by you, using Scratch!

Your jumper cables should all have hollow 'F' ends that fit over the pins. 

Connect a jumper cable to Pin 1, making sure it is an F-F wire. Pin 1 is always on and provides 3 V of power to whatever you connect to it.

Insert the **long leg** of your LED into the other end of this jumper cable. Take a second F-F jumper cable and attach it to the **short leg** or your LED.

Take a resistor and insert one of itâ€™s legs into the other end of the second jumper cable. Insert the other leg into another F-F jumper cable. Adding the resistor to your circuit controls the **electrical current** passing through the circuit; this will protect the LED from burning out.

Now, connect your circuit back to Pin 6 using the the loose end of the F-F jumper cable. As soon as you close the circuit by connecting it back to your ground pin, your LED should light up!

If your LED isn't lighting up, make sure you have the **long leg** connected to the output pin (Pin 1) and the **short leg** connected to the ground pin (Pin 6). LEDs only work one way round!

If your LED **still** isn't lighting up, check all your connections are secure and fit properly, then swap your LED for another one if it still won't work (this one might be broken).

In the next step, you will swap your working circuit to a numbered control pin so that you can drive it using code!
