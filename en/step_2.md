## Test your circuit

In this step, you will connect an LED and resistor to the Raspberry Pi to test your circuit.

Your jumper wire should have hollow female ends that fit over the pins. Connect a jumper wire to Pin 1, making sure it is a female to female wire. Pin 1 is always on and provides 3 volts of power to whatever you connect to it.

Take a resistor and insert one of itâ€™s legs into the other end of the jumper cable attached to Pin 1. Insert the other leg into another female-female jumper cable.

Insert the **long** leg of your LED into the end of this jumper cable, and connect the short leg back to Pin6 using another female-female jumper cable. As soon as you close the circuit by connecting it back to your ground pin, your LED will light up!
