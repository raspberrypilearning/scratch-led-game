--- choices ---

- ( ) Connect the long leg of the LED to the GND pin and the short leg to the 3V3 pin with a resistor in between

  --- feedback ---
  Current always flows from a 3V3 pin to GND. LEDs only work *one way*.

- (x) Connect the long leg of the LED to the 3V3 pin and the short leg to a GND pin, with a resistor in between.

  --- feedback ---
Yes, current will flow from the 3V3 pin, through the resistor and then to the GND pin.
