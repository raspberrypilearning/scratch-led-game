When connecting an LED and a resistor to your Raspberry Pi, it is important to test that your circuit is working correctly. How do you do this?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Connect the long leg of the LED to the GND pin and the short leg to the 3V3 pin with a resistor in between

  --- feedback ---
Current always flows from a 3V3 pin to GND. LEDs only work *one way*.
  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Connect the long leg of the LED to the 3V3 pin and the short leg to a GND pin, with a resistor in between

  --- feedback ---
Yes, current will flow from the 3V3 pin, through the resistor and then to the GND pin

- ( ) Connect the long leg of the LED to a numbered pin and the short leg to the GND pin with a resistor in between

  --- feedback ---
Current always flows from a 3V3 pin to GND. LEDs only work *one way*.
