- ( ) Raspberry Pi GPIO

  --- feedback ---
No, we didn't use this one. While this is a good extension for electronics, we didn't use this one today. GPIO is a little more tricky to use, but it allows lots of options when coding!

- ( ) Raspberry Pi SenseHAT

  --- feedback ---
No, we didn't use this one. This is an extension specifically for use with the SenseHAT add-on like the one on board the Space Station (which you can use with the AstroPi competition)!

- ( ) MakeyMakey

  --- feedback ---
No, we didn't use this one. This extension is used specifically with the MakeyMakey, a fun gadget that helps you create amazing inventions!
