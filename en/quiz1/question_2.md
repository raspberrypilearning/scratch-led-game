Which Scratch extension did you use to control your LED in this project?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Raspberry Pi GPIO

  --- feedback ---
No, we didn't use this one. While this is a good extension for electronics, we didn't use this one today. GPIO is a little more tricky to use, but it allows lots of options when coding!s

- ( ) MakeyMakey

  --- feedback ---
No, we didn't use this one. This extension is used specifically with the MakeyMakey, a fun gadget that helps you create amazing inventions!

- ( ) Raspberry Pi SenseHAT

--- feedback ---
No, we didn't use this one. This is an extension specifically for use with the SenseHAT add-on (like the one on board the Space Station which you can use with the AstroPi competition!)

- (x) Raspberry Pi Simple Electronics

  --- feedback ---
  Yes! This extension is the simplest one for using GPIO quickly, and the one we used today.
