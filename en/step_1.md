## Introduction

In this project, you'll take your first step in using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to make machines! You'll be connecting wires and lights to your Pi to create simple electrical circuits, then linking it up to a computer game so that you can find the hidden hedgehog!

### Hardware

+ A Raspberry Pi computer
+ 3x F-F jumper cables
+ an LED
+ a resistor (the lower resistance, the better!)

### Software

+ Scratch 3 Desktop - This project can not be completed using the online Scratch editor, and must be completed using a Raspberry Pi with the desktop version installed.

### Downloads
