## What next?
You could now add some fun `sounds`{:class="block3sound"} to your game to celebrate finding the hedgehog, or attach another LED to a different pin and have it light up when you get further away!

If you are following the Scratch Physical Computing 1 Pathway, you could try the [Robot Buggy](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/motor-robot-buggy-scratch){:target="_blank"} project where you will connect motors to your Raspberry Pi and make a robot buggy with Scratch!

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&curriculum%5B%5D=%201).
