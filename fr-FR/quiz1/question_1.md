When connecting an LED to your Raspberry Pi, it is important to test that your circuit is working correctly. Comment tu fais ça ?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Connect the LED to a power pin and a ground pin, but don't use a resistor.

  --- feedback --- You should use a resistor to protect your LED. If you don't, it might shatter! --- /feedback ---

- (x) Connect the LED to a power pin and a ground pin, and use a resistor.

  --- feedback --- Yes, current will flow from the power pin, through the resistor and then to the ground pin. --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Connect the LED to any two pins and use a resistor.

  --- feedback --- This won't necessarily work, you must make sure you connect the LED to power and ground pins. --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Connect a resistor between the two legs of the LED.

  --- feedback --- This won't do anything as you will have no power to your circuit. --- /feedback ---
